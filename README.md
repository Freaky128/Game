Hi guys,
This is a 2D semi top down pokemon like game me and a mate are developing. 
It is written in C++ using the Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) API libraries.
The game utilises a simple engine I've written from scratch.
The end goal is a fully developed expansive game, the premise of which is a pokemon like game but instead of pokemon, it's real animals, ecosystems and enviroments. Also potentially looking at doing real time in game battles instead of turn based abstract battles. 
The code is a tad messy at the moment and isn't noted but feel free to have a look around.
